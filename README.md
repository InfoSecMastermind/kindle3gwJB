# Kindle 3rd Generation Keyboard Jailbreak
Kindle 3rd Gen or Keyboard Jail Break Guide Made Easy

It had been difficult to do so to jailbreak a 15 year old kindle, it does not have much support in the forums and proper guides. The 3rd Gen kindle is truly iconic and still very usable to this day, and even more usable if it is jailbroken as that enables you to read any book you want in almost any format, you could straight up install linux on it the possiblities are endless. It has every feature needed, from wifi to headphone, I wish it had bluetooth too. On low light its ofcourse imposiible to read due no backlit but it manageable with a clip on light or its amazon kindle cover with light is not bad too i heard.

So how to jailbreak it: (for firmware 3.4.x)

1: Download https://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=141327&d=1440341398 this will have the .bin file that can be used as an update. The zip file be downloaded which will contain the update for different models, see that here https://kindlemodding.org/jailbreaking/kindle-models.html

then place the one for your model to the kindle root directory when connected to the computer.

 after transfered eject it and then [HOME] -> [MENU] > Settings -> [MENU] > Update Your Kindle.

2: The the Mobileread Kindlet Kit will need to be installed that can be downloaded here https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/Touch/kindle-mkk-20141129-r18833.tar.xz it will need to exctracted and then again the update for your own will need to be placed.

And then updated. It is that the normal MKK file does no work due to developer.keystore expiration that is where most of the time went to finding the updated one. So the available MKK will need to be replaced with one's here https://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?s=eb39c995878c7338dbb58c12e0f9ebb4&attachmentid=215127&d=1745098511 then updated. That fixes the "This device is not registered as a Test Kindle to run this title." issue.

3: After that the KUAL can be installed it will enable the KOreader and make things more accessible on the kindle. it can be downloaded here https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/KUAL/KUAL-v2.7.37-gfcb45b5-20250419.tar.xz and extract it then use KUAL-KDK-1.0.azw2 only by placing it in the documents folder. Then running it as a book. 

4: Then to finally install KOReeader, download https://github.com/koreader/koreader/releases/download/v2024.04/koreader-kindle-legacy-v2024.04.zip the legacy version and then extract it into the root directory of kindle and then run it through KUAL. Many other things like screensavers, extensions and the fonts can be installed too now from here https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030 and here https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88004. The official kindle screensaver are too good in my opinion and the defaut font works the best the others cause scaling issues I think.

Feel free to make an issue if you encounter any issues following it i really want to simplify it while ensuring its foolproof.
